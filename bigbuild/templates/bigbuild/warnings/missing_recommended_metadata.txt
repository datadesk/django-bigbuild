The page at {{ page.slug }} is missing some recommended values in its ``metadata.md`` file.

These values are not required to publish a page, but you're likely to have bugs
with how your page appears on social media without them.

To fix this problem, open up the file at {{ page.frontmatter_path }}

Then make sure each of the following fields is filled in:

* headline
* description
* byline
* image_url

This is not a huge emergency, but this needs to get sorted out.
